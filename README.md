AOC solutions in Guile Scheme

This repository contains a set of solutions to AOC in Guile Scheme

The code is commented and organized.

There may be some practices that are non-standard.  It uses several
Guile data types instead of R6RS data types.  It uses named let
bindings as helper functions instead of pure recursive functions.  But
otherwise it should provide some good examples.

There are tests available for most days.

To run the tests:

make test

To run the code on the test data available for each day:

make
